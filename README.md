# Campus Discovery and Exploration
The current project is part of SI 699 UX mastery course at the Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information. 
The project aims to help students get more familiar with campus, especially campus buildings, and help them find their way through campus discovery and exploration. We attemped to implement one of the core features of the product, indoor navigation, using Framer X combined with Mapbox API. To access the demo, please follow the instructions below.

Please to be noticed that the following steps only allow you to interact with one of the many features of the system. Full interactive demonstration can be found here:

## Installing
Downlaod the entire folder and open it with Framer X. To install Framer X, please direct to https://framer.com/.

After opening the project in Framer X, allow 10 seconds for API and components to fully load. You can start preview (cmd+p) from the Home page. The followings outline what you can do to interact with the application.
* Click on the bottom dialogue and start inddor navigation.
* Enter your current location (any landmark/room numbers close to you) and your destination. Notice that the current demo only allows three preset route. Try enter "Room 1295" to "Room 3360"; "Media Gateway" to "Space 2435"; and "Room 1255" to "Student and Faculty Lounge".
